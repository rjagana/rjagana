### Hi there 👋

## I'm Ruchitha, and I'm a Junior at Purdue University studying Computer Science! 👩‍💻

I'm currently exploring the Software Engineering track and Machine Learning Track, but I love exploring various realms of technology and am always interested in working on new projects!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a personal cookbook website, and building a deeper understanding on algorithms!
- 🌱 I’m also currently getting a certification as an AWS Cloud Practitioner!
- 📫 I'm always looking to connect with new people and/or collaborate with them on projects, so feel free to reach out to me!
