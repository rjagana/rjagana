### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

âœ¨ I'm Ruchitha, and I'm a Junior at Purdue University studying Computer Science! âœ¨

I'm currently exploring the Software Engineering track and Machine Learning Track, but I love exploring various realms of technology and am always interested in working on new projects!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a personal cookbook website, and building a deeper understanding on algorithms!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m also currently learning AWS!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: I'm always looking to connect with new people and/or collaborate with them on projects, so feel free to reach out to me!
